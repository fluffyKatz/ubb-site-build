<h1>Our Programs</h1>
<p>
Our three-tier educational approach aims to be as inclusive as possible, recognizing the diverse interests, talents, and academic preparedness of prisoners. At the broadest level, University Beyond Bars (UBB) offers a twice-monthly arts and lectures series open to all prisoners. The second tier includes certificate courses, many of which are comparable to college courses in academic rigor and student demands. The third tier is comprised of college preparatory courses which function as a gateway into our credit-bearing college courses. These courses are taught by faculty and advanced graduate instructors from local colleges and universities. UBB typically offers 18-20 courses per semester.</p>

<h3>College Pathway</h3> 
<p>Students who complete a UBB college preparatory curriculum in Math and English or demonstrate college readiness in proficiency examinations matriculate as part or full-time students working toward an Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree, awarded by our academic partner Seattle Central College.</p>

<h3>Certificate Pathway</h3>
<p>Encourages students who have completed their secondary education to continue their studies by enrolling in a variety of short- and medium-term non-credit courses designed to inspire interest in higher education.</p>

<h3>Arts and Lecture Series</h3>
<p>provides open access to one-time lectures and guest performances that expose prisoners to cultural events and inspire interest in the arts, sciences, and liberal learning. Click here to read more about upcoming series events.</p>
<p>
Prisoners are often assigned to take Department of Corrections programs, but participation in UBB is always elective. Courses are selected with the help of our Prisoner Advisory Committee (PAC) and Education Advisory Committee (EAC). Our schedule for the Spring 2014 semester (January-June 2014) can be viewed here</p>
